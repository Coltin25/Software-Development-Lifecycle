# Software-Development-Lifecycle
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs as a requirement for a successful program. I want to make the program userfriendly and allow for ease of use. When creating user stories it can describe how the program should function. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I start from the ground up when developing programs, I utilize story boards, sprints, and a prioritization list to create a path of most important piece of the project to the least important. I normally create a framework of code to allow for testing then develop from most to least important lines of code. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member completes their tasks on time and goes above and beyond to deliver the best product for the user. A good team member also keeps other accountable and offers help where its needed.
